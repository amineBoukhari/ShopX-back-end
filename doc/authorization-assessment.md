# ShopX Authorization Assessment

## Identified API Endpoints Missing Authorization Controls

After reviewing the shopx-auth-service codebase, I've identified several areas where authorization controls appear to be insufficient or inconsistent:

### 1. StoreController
- The `getStoreById` method in the StoreService contains a commented-out authorization check:
```java
// if (!hasAccess(store, user)) {
//     throw new UnauthorizedException("Access denied");
// }
```
This suggests that the authorization control was disabled, allowing potentially unauthorized access to store data.

### 2. Public Endpoints
- The SecurityConfig permits access to several endpoints without authentication:
  - `/login`, `/register` (expected for authentication endpoints)
  - `/oauth2/**` (expected for OAuth2 flow)
  - `/swagger-ui/**`, `/v3/api-docs/**` (documentation)
  - `/refresh` and `refresh` (token refresh endpoint)
  - `api/invitations/**` (all invitation-related endpoints)

The last point about invitations is concerning, as it appears all invitation-related endpoints are permitted without authentication, even those that should be restricted.

### 3. Missing Role-Based Access Controls
- Many endpoints check if a user is authenticated but do not consistently verify if they have the appropriate role to perform the requested action.
- The `/api/invitations/{invitationId}/accept` and `/api/invitations/{invitationId}/reject` endpoints require authentication but do not verify if the authenticated user has the right to access the specified invitation.

### 4. Incomplete JWT Token Validation
- The JWTService creates tokens with store access roles, but many endpoints don't leverage this information to validate if the user has the appropriate store-level permissions.

### 5. Missing Resource Ownership Verification
- Some endpoints modify resources without verifying that the authenticated user owns the resource or has appropriate permissions.

### 6. Inconsistent Authorization Pattern
- Authorization checks vary across controllers and services, with some implementing thorough checks (e.g., `isOwner` in StoreService) while others rely solely on basic authentication.

## High-Priority Security Concerns

1. **Commented-Out Authorization Check**: The disabled authorization check in `getStoreById` should be re-enabled immediately, as it could allow any authenticated user to access any store data.

2. **Over-Permissive Invitation API**: The configuration permits unauthenticated access to all invitation-related endpoints, which could enable unauthorized users to manipulate invitations.

3. **Inconsistent Role Enforcement**: The StoreRole system defines OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, and STAFF roles, but role-based access control isn't consistently applied across endpoints.
