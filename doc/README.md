## Contents

### 1. [Authorization Assessment](./authorization-assessment.md)
A detailed assessment of the original authorization implementation in ShopX, identifying gaps and security concerns that needed to be addressed.

### 2. [Authorization Solution](./authorization-solution.md)
The technical solution for implementing a centralized, role-based authorization system in ShopX, including key components, patterns, and implementation details.

### 3. [Authorization Rules](./authorization-rules.md)
Comprehensive documentation of the authorization rules, including:
- Technical documentation of the role hierarchy and permission mappings
- API endpoint authorization requirements
- User-facing documentation explaining store roles and permissions

### 4. [Testing Documentation](./testing-documentation.md)
Detailed information about the test suite created to validate the authorization system, including test categories, coverage, and how to run the tests.

### 5. [Implementation Guide](./project-implementation-guide.md)
A step-by-step guide for implementing the authorization system, including troubleshooting advice and configuration changes.

## System Overview

The ShopX authorization system uses a role-based access control (RBAC) approach with a hierarchical permission structure. Key components include:

1. **Centralized Authorization Service**: A dedicated service that encapsulates all authorization logic
2. **Aspect-Oriented Security**: Using annotations and aspects to apply security checks without cluttering business logic
3. **Enhanced JWT Tokens**: Including detailed permission information in authentication tokens
4. **Role Hierarchy**: OWNER > ADMIN > MANAGER > STAFF, with appropriate permission inheritance

## Key Features

- **Consistent Authorization**: Uniform enforcement of authorization rules across all endpoints
- **Declarative Security**: Security requirements clearly visible in controller method declarations
- **Separation of Concerns**: Authorization logic separated from business logic
- **Testability**: Centralized service makes testing authorization rules straightforward

## Getting Started

To understand the ShopX authorization system:

1. Start with the [Authorization Assessment](./authorization-assessment.md) to understand the initial state
2. Read the [Authorization Solution](./authorization-solution.md) to understand the approach taken
3. Review the [Authorization Rules](./authorization-rules.md) for details on the permission system
4. Consult the [Implementation Guide](./project-implementation-guide.md) for implementation details
5. Check the [Testing Documentation](./testing-documentation.md) to understand how the system is validated
